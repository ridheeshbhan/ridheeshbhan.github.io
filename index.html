					<h2>At My Current Employer</h2><br /></h2>
					<p>At my current role, I’ve led several high-impact strategic initiatives-reducing device disablement <br />by 12%
						through payment behavior analysis, increasing daily payment recovery by ~10%<br /> using data-driven call strategies, 
						
						and improving targeting accuracy by 30% in partnership with the Data Science team.<br> I drove an 8% rise
						 in repeat purchases and a 5% boost in customer lifetime value<br> through a CEO-prioritized campaign,
						executed under tight timelines. <br>Additionally, I designed agentless workflows that cut operational costs by up to 11%,
						introduced new performance metrics, <br>and ran A/B tests that increased ROI by 200% in call center operations. <br>
						My work has consistently informed executive decisions and was recognized with a <b>Dedicated Service Award.</b><br><br>

					<h2>CEO Dashboard - Google Sheets</h2>
					
						
					<p>The snip has some visuals used on our 
						CEO's Dashboard. This is our one stop shop.<br><br>
						
						
						Our data sits on Streamline (VRMS), we 
						export it regualarly as streamline does not have
						an API/ external connection. This data is cleansed and transformed
						 with a single macro before refreshing 
						 on the Dashboard and Visuals. <br><br>
						 This Dashboard works with 11 KPIs not limited to Occupancy, Avg Nightly
						  Rate, Avg Stay Length, Revenue, etc.
						  The dashboard shows details based on Booking platforms, Locations,
						   Agents, Number of Children and Adults (further breaks down into age groups).
						   This dashboard also gives us our Income and Expenses.

					<h2>Sales and Revenue - Power BI</h2>
						
					<p>One of our clients wanted to get a dashboard that connects 
						with Sage(ERP) and show their Sales, Purchases, Stock, 
						Nominal Ledger and Net Revenue. Sage had a connection with Power BI using
						AAD.<br><br>They requested for some 
						drill downs on NL (Code -> Department -> Cost 
						Centre) and some other filters/drill downs that would dynamically 
						refresh the data. We had to clean and transform the data in Power Query. 
						It was important to keep data that is invoiced and remove Sales/Purchases 
						that were not. The connection was unable to get details on invoiced data 
						so we had to manually create a relation using helper columns.<br>
						<br>Their companies data was then compared with similar organizations 
						to give them a real picture of the business. This data was collected 
						by the client in an excel file.<br><br>

						Please check the image for some visuals used in that Dashboard.

					<h2>Sales Dashboard - Excel</h2>
					<p>The client wanted to get a Pivot Table with his Sales data based 
						on Sales Rep -> Sales Region -> Stock details at the minimum cost possible. 
						He had a temp solution based on thousands of formulas that took ages for him 
						to filter the data and get the right results. His objective was to get the data 
						and email it to individuals every Monday. <br><br>
						We created a Pivot table in Excel that worked on a SQL view created for partial 
						cleaning of data. We did not clean the data fully in SQL because our client had 
						further plans to add KPIs and Visuals. We added buttons to filter the Pivot Table 
						by current month, current year, last 3 years, etc. We added another button to send 
						an email to Sales Rep with only their data, the button had a macro that would filter 
						data for a Rep, create a new file with the data, store that data on our client's server 
						backup and send that file in email. This was all hardcoded because our company was 
						charging them based on licenses, we added sales rep's email ids in the macro itself.
						<br><br> The project had further developments as our client was surprised with how 
						robust and powerful excel could be.
