					<h2>At My Current Employer</h2><br /></h2>
					<p>At my current role, I’ve led several high-impact strategic initiatives-reducing device disablement by 12%
						through payment behavior analysis, increasing daily payment recovery by ~10% using data-driven call strategies, 
						and improving targeting accuracy by 30% in partnership with the Data Science team.<br> I drove an 8% rise
						 in repeat purchases and a 5% boost in customer lifetime value through a CEO-prioritized campaign,
						executed under tight timelines. <br>Additionally, I designed agentless workflows that cut operational costs by up to 11%,
						introduced new performance metrics, and ran A/B tests that increased ROI by 200% in call center operations. <br>
						My work has consistently informed executive decisions and was recognized with a <b>Dedicated Service Award.</b><br><br>

					<h2>CEO Dashboard - Google Sheets</h2>
					
						
					<p>The snip has some visuals used on our 
						CEO's Dashboard. This is our one stop shop.<br><br>
						
						
						Our data originates from Streamline (VRMS), which
						 lacks an external API connection, so we export it regularly for analysis. 
						A single macro is used to cleanse and transform the
						data before refreshing the dashboards and visuals.
						The dashboard tracks 11+ key performance indicators, including Occupancy, Average
						 Nightly Rate, Average Stay Length, and Revenue. It offers detailed insights by booking 
						 platform, location, agent, and guest composition—including age breakdowns for both children and adults.
						 children and adults. It also provides a comprehensive view of our income and expenses.

					<h2>Sales and Revenue - Power BI</h2>
						
					<p>One of our clients needed a Power BI dashboard integrated with their 
						Sage ERP system to visualize Sales, Purchases, Stock, Nominal Ledger, 
						and Net Revenue. Since Sage supported AAD-based Power BI integration, 
						we connected the data and used Power Query for cleansing and transformation.<br/><br/>
						Key requirements included drill-downs for the Nominal Ledger 
						(from Code to Department to Cost Centre) and dynamic filters that refreshed 
						in real-time. As Sage didn’t directly flag invoiced transactions, 
						we built custom logic using helper columns to isolate invoiced data only.<br/><br/>
						We also incorporated benchmarking by comparing their performance against 
						similar organizations, using external data provided by the client in Excel.</p>

					<h2>Sales Dashboard - Excel</h2>
					<p>A client needed a low-cost solution to generate weekly Sales reports segmented by Sales Rep → Sales Region → Stock details, 
						replacing a slow, formula-heavy setup. We built a dynamic Excel Pivot Table powered by a partially cleaned SQL view, 
						with plans to expand into KPI tracking and visuals.<br/><br/>
						Interactive filters were added for time ranges (e.g., current month, year, last 3 years), along with a macro-enabled 
						button that auto-filtered each Sales Rep’s data, generated individual files, saved them to the server, 
						and emailed them directly—fully hardcoded to avoid license costs.<br/><br/>
						The client was impressed by Excel’s capabilities, and the project expanded as a
						result of the system’s speed, automation, and simplicity.
